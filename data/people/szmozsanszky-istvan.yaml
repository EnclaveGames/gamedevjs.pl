    _Flaki_, for short. He is a JavaScript engineer and trainer from Budapest. He runs his own consulting
    business [Skylark](http://twitter.com/skylark_ee), is a Frontend Trainer at [DPC Consulting](http://www.dpc.hu/) and a longtime Mozilla-contributor.

    He's worked on, and continues to contribute to various open source projects like Firefox, Firefox OS,
    Rust, Servo and the Tessel Project. He's a [frequent speaker](http://slides.com/flaki/) at conferences, and an [organizer himself](http://www.rustfest.eu/about/).
    His favorite topics include service workers, progressive webapps, JavaScript's history, internals,
    and JS on microcontrollers — more often than not he's even caught prophesying [JavaScript's world domination](https://medium.com/@slsoftworks/javascript-world-domination-af9ca2ee5070). ;)
